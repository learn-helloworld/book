= Writing our first program

The first thing you do when learning a (new) programming language is creating a "Hello World" program ... ironic.
The only thing that this program does is displaying "Hello World" on the console.

[,helloworld]
----
std.helloworld();
----

But what if we want to display sonething else? Of course the `helloworld()` function is just a little easter egg.
To actually display text, we use the `println()` function as follows.

[,helloworld]
----
std.println("Good Bye, World!");
----
